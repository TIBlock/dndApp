Beginning creation of dice rolling app
Starting with creating simple dice rolling mechanic that can be used throughout the app. 
Looking to find how to create a custom buttom to change the singe dice rolling function to roll whatever number is assigned to the button. It makes sense that a single function would be called for all potential dice rolling no matter how many sides. Once I get this operation figured out I want to try and create a basic webpage with an array of gaming dice to roll.
